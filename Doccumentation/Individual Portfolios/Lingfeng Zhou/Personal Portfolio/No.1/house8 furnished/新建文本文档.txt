weekly rent $780 furnished

The designer of this spacious home clearly understood the logistical challenges that confront a family, because the home's double-level floorplan is a work of domestic genius. In total the accommodation consists of 4 generous bedrooms, an office and 2.5 smart bathrooms ( Almost 40 squares). You'll also appreciate the flexibility offered by the separate lounge and rumpus rooms, the second-storey family room and the ample storage built in throughout. Just a few steps through the front door of this radiant family home will leave you in the midst of one of the most warm and welcoming open plan living areas you're likely to encounter. 
Extras like ducted air conditioning and super- sized kitchen with quality appliances and high quality polished tiles complete the picture. 
Walk out onto a private and tranquil outdoor area with landscaped gardens that leads to a fully fenced pool. Three additional off street parking spaces will really come in handy as the family grows up.
